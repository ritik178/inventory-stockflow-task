# Stockflow Inventory Task

This project is built for the **Internship Task provided by StockFlow**, where we were asked to design an **Inventory Alert System** using one of the mentioned technologies (Node.js, Python, or Spring Boot). I chose **Spring Boot**, as I have experience and confidence in backend development with Java.

---

## âœ… Why Spring Boot?

Although Python was one of the mentioned options, I chose **Spring Boot** because:
- I am more experienced in Java and Spring Boot.
- It allowed me to implement everything cleanly and confidently.
- The goal of the task was to focus on core logic and features â€” which I delivered fully using Spring Boot.

## ðŸ“‹ Task Requirements

1. Design an inventory alert system where:
   - If stock goes below 10, an alert should be generated.
   - If stock goes above 10, the alert should be removed.
2. A background process (cron or scheduler) should **check inventory every 5 minutes**.
3. Create APIs to:
   - Get all alerts
   - Get alerts by category
   - Get alerts by brand
4. Use **MySQL** as the database.

## âœ… Technologies Used

- **Spring Boot (Java)**
- **MySQL**
- **Spring Data JPA**
- **Lombok**
- **Maven**

## âœ… Progress

### âœ… Step 1: Project Initialized using Spring Initializr  
- Group: com.stockflow  
- Artifact: inventorytask  
- Dependencies: Spring Web, JPA, MySQL Driver, Lombok

### âœ… Step 2: MySQL Configuration
- `application.properties` configured
- Database created: `inventory_task`

### âœ… Step 3: Entity Setup
- `Product` entity with unique `sku`
- `Warehouse` entity with `location`

### âœ… Step 4: Inventory Entity Created
- Connects Product and Warehouse with stock quantity

### âœ… Step 5: Repository Layer
- `ProductRepository`, `WarehouseRepository`, `InventoryRepository`

### âœ… Step 6: Created DTOs
- `ProductDto`, `WarehouseDto`, `InventoryDto`

### âœ… Step 7: Service Layer
- Added service interfaces and implementations for:
  - Product
  - Warehouse
  - Inventory

### step 8 completed 
-controller layer

# Inventory Management & Alerting System

## Progress Overview

### âœ… DB Entities Implemented:
- Product
- Warehouse
- Inventory
- Company
- Supplier
- SalesActivity
- ProductSupplier

### âœ… Spring Boot Project Setup:
- Initialized with Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, H2 (or MySQL), Lombok

### ðŸ”œ Next Steps:
- Implement the `/api/companies/{id}/alerts/low-stock` endpoint
- Write custom query logic for low stock detection
- Add controller/service layers for alert response


### âœ… API Implemented: Low Stock Alert
- GET /api/companies/{companyId}/alerts/low-stock
- Returns products below stock threshold
- Includes product, warehouse, stock, threshold, reorderQty, supplier contact

### json example

[
  {
    "productName": "Laptop",
    "warehouseName": "Warehouse A",
    "currentStock": 3,
    "threshold": 5,
    "reorderQuantity": 10,
    "supplierName": "Dell Supplier",
    "supplierEmail": "supplier@dell.com",
    "supplierPhone": "9876543210"
  }
